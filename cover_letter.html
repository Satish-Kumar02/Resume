Hiring Manager<br>
Company Name
</p>

<p>
Dear Hiring Manager,
</p>

<p>
I am writing to apply for the Engineer, QA 1 1 position. With over 3.5 years of
hands-on experience in test automation, API testing, and end-to-end validation across telecom and enterprise
systems, I bring a strong quality engineering mindset combined with practical automation expertise.
</p>

<p>
In my current role at Comcast, I perform end-to-end testing of buy-flow journeys within a large-scale telecom
commerce ecosystem. My responsibilities include validating microservice interactions, analyzing backend logs,
executing API testing using SOAP UI, and ensuring contract compatibility between dependent services. I have
also developed automated API test scripts to improve regression efficiency and reduce post-release defects.
</p>

<p>
Previously at Infosys, I worked extensively on web and IVR systems, building UI regression automation using
Selenium and Cucumber BDD, executing API testing with Postman and SOAP UI, and developing IVR automation scripts
using Cyara. These efforts helped reduce manual validation effort and improve release stability.
</p>

<p>
I am comfortable working in Agile environments, collaborating closely with developers, product owners, and
cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software. My technical foundation in Python, Selenium, Pytest,
REST/SOAP APIs, and microservices validation allows me to contribute effectively to both functional and
automation-focused initiatives.
</p>

<p>
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your quality engineering
needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.
</p>

Satish Kumar
